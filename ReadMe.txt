Welcome to Marshes' Melons, a platformer game by Jack Ersbo!

In this game, the goal is to collect all the melons in as short of a time as possible! The character in the game uses the arrow keys for movement.

Marshes' Melons is very much a work in progress, as I will be adding more levels and new mechanics in the coming weeks. There is also some clunkiness with the platform and player collisions, so more work is needed. 

Melons uses the Phaser 3 Javascript library to help streamline many of the tedious processes encountered when building a browser game. Specifically, Phaser has a handy physics engine, collision engine, frame generator for loading spritesheet animations, and much more! It also loads on a traditional HTML5 canvas, allowing traditional canvas methods work in tandem.

Thanks for checking out my work and be sure to check back in the coming weeks!
